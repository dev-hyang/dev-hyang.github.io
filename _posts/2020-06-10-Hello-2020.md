## This is to notedown my start of Oarpark community.

### 致未来的你的公开信
<h1>Hello, community members:</h1>
>I really appreciate BY-qiubaiying who wrote such a wonderful blog creation [guide](https://github.com/qiubaiying/qiubaiying.github.io/wiki/%E5%8D%9A%E5%AE%A2%E6%90%AD%E5%BB%BA%E8%AF%A6%E7%BB%86%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B). As for me, this is a great place to note down what I have in my mind and what I want to say to the future ones, my family and myself. 
 
This domain gives me a quite place to settle down my spirit in my sparing time. It mainly serves for special moments, technical supports and spiritual journey.


## Markdown References
>Previously I just write some Markdown notes in the jupyternotebook.
There are two references I would usually turn to:
. 1, [Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
. 2, [Markdown Math Equations](https://www.math.ubc.ca/~pwalls/math-python/jupyter/markdown/)
