## React Intro
<strong>React</strong> is a JavaScript library for building UI. It could build single page applications.
- Practice 1:
	<q>
		import React from 'react';
		import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
		class Test extends React.Component {
			render(){
				return <h1>Bonjour!</h1>;
			}
		}
		ReactDOM.render(<Test />, document.getElementById('root'));
	</q>
- Practice 2: Create React App and Run it
	You can use command npx if you have already installed npm and Node.js on your PC. THe command would look like npx create-react-app my-project-app. Then it will auto set up everything for you. In the CLT, go to the my-project-app and run "npm start" you will be directed to localhost:3000 if everything is set up correctly.
