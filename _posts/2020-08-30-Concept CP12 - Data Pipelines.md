- A data pipeline is a series of steps or actions(typically automated) to move and combine data from various sources for analysis and visualization.
- Wiki: a data pipeline is a set of data processing elements connected in series, where the output of one element is the input of the next one. The elements of a pipeline are often excuted in parallel or in time-sliced fashion.

ETL is Extract, Transform, Load - which denotes the process of extracting data from a resource, transforming it to fit your database, and loading it into a table.
