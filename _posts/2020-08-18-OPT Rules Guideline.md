- OPT Defined
	- Post-Complete OPT
		* after completion of degree coursework
		* max 12 months per educational level
		* authorization to work, anywhere in the U.S. in a job directly related to major area of study as defined on the students' I-20
- Eligibility
	* valid F-1 visa status
	* full-time enrollment in bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree program for min of one academic year
	* physical presence in the US
	* have not completed 12 months full-time CPT
	* No job offer required!
- Timelines
	* The program completion date drives all other OPT timelines and is the place to start this process!
	* program completion date = end of academic activity != graduation ceremony or degree awarded date
	* What is my program completion date?
		- date marks end of academic activity at per university/college, like UIC
		- discussion between you and your department advisor, who knows your program well
		- I-20 end date will adjust to match, impacting work authorizations & enrollment requirements
		- Different from coursework completion vs. thesis/dissertation students
			- Coursework Completion, date of final exam, last class, or final project/presentation
			- Thesis or Dissertation, identify an academic milestone that best matches your situation, defense date, date final edits due to advisor, submission of thesis to Graduate College.
	* What is not my program completion date?
		- Graduation ceremony
		- Degree awarded date
		- Last day of on-campus job or intership
		- A random date I picked that has nothing to do with the end of my academic activity at UIC.
	* OPT Application Window
		Once you know your program completion date, you can figure out when to apply for OPT.
		*Like Earliest Application Date 2/14/2020 ----- -90 days ------ Program Completion Date 5/15/20220 ------ + 60 days ------ Latest OPT Application Date 7/14/2020*
		- When should I apply for OPT?
			* As early as possible
			* No job needed to apply, just intention to work
			* USCIS must receive your application no later than 30 days after OIS issues OPT I-20 or 60 days after program completion, whichever is earlier.
			* Applying early increases the chance that you will receive the EAD before program completion. This facilitates international travel and job interview.
	* OPT Start Window
		- When preparing your OPT application, you'll need to request an OPT start date.
		start date = program completion date 5/15/2020 + random(1, 60) days, the earliest could be 5/16/2020, the latest could be 7/14/2020
		- What's OPT Start date?
			* Date that you request USCIS to begin your work authorization
			* Must be within 60 days of program completion
			* After OPT is approved, cannot begin working until you reach the OPT start date
			* cannot change your requested OPT start date after mailing application to USCIS
		- How to pick up OPT start date?
			* want to start working asap? = pick early dates
			* need time to job search ? = pick later dates
			* family visiting or want to travel U.S? = pick later dates
			* Consider USCIS processing time ! 2-4 months
			* Ultimately, a personal choice (best guess?)
			if USCIS adjudicates your application after your requested OPT start date, the official will typically move the start date to the date of adjudication. But you will lose OPT period = adjudication date - requested start date.
		- How to pick up OPT end date?
			* must be within 12 months of CPT start and 14 months of program completion
			* date that you request USCIS to end your work authorization
			* Almost everyone requests full 12 months
			* cannot change your requested OPT end date after mailing application to USCIS.
		Applying for OPT early increases the chance you'll receive your EAD before your program completion date and with the entire 12 months of work authorization.
- Work Requirements
	- What Job Type is appropriate for OPT?
		* Regular paid employment
		* multiple short-term employers (gigs)
		* work for hire/staffing agency (1099 contractor)
		* self-employment with appropriate license
		* volunteer or unpaid internship that do not violate labor laws
	- What job duties are okay for OPT?
		* Duties must be directly related to the major area of study listed on I20
		* No pre-approved list, use your best judgement
		* Ask for employer documentation if connection is not clear from job title
		* Discuss any doubts regarding appropriate job duties with an OIS advisor
	- What work hours are okay for OPT?
		* 20+ hours per week = employed
		* 19- hours per week = unemployed
		* Variable schedule must average 20+ hours per week within month
		* Multiple jobs must add up to 20+ hours per week
	- 90 day unemployment limit
		* if your employement status does not meet the OPT work requirement you are considered to be unemployed
		* limit of 90 unemployment days during OPT authorized period
		* unemployment clock starts on EAD start
		* unemployment days are cumulative and counted as calendar days, not business days. For exmaple, EAD start at 5/15/2020, unemployed 30 days, employed by A company, unemployed 15 days, employed by B company. Total unemployed days are 45 days.
		* Holidays and approved vacations while otherwise employed do not count toward unemployment.
		* After 90 days of unemployment, your EAD ends early.
- Reporting Requirements
	- OIS will update your SEVIS record which can be seen by various government offices.
	- Report to OIS within 10 days:
		- When you receive EAD from USCIS
		- Change of name
		- Change of address, phone, email
		- Change in employment status or information
			* Starting a new job
			* Leaving a job
			* Starting a second, third, fourth job
			* Employer name or address change
			* Change in work hours that results in less than 20 hours per week = unemployment
		- [OPT Update Form](ois.uic.edu/students/currentstudents/forms)
		if you don't submit an OPT update form with job information the unemployment clock keeps ticking! Make sure to request an I-20 reprint if you want a copy of your I-20 including the new employer information.
	- SEVP Portal
		- Access your SEVP protal to review your current contact and employment information
		- Submit any changes in contact or employment information via the OPT Update Form to OIS. 
		- A designated school official (DSO) will update your SEVIS record with those changes
		- The SEVP portal will reflect those changes in 2-3 business days.

- Travel
	- Return to U.S before the program completion date will be ok if still considered a student, carry valid passport, valid F-1 visa, I-20 with travel signature <6 months old.
	- Return to U.S after the program completion date without EAD, not recommended, cannot respond quickly to OPT RFE, or EAD receipt. If OPT is denied, no basis for return to U.S
	- Return to U.S after the program completion date with EAD, be cautious, carry valid passport, valid F-1 visa, I-20 with travel signature < 6 months old, job letter, increased risk if no job or lots of unemployment days.
- Life after OPT
