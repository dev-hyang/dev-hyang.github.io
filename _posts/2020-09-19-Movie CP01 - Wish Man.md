One boy's wish change a man. One man's wish changed the world.
This is a review of the film **Wish Man**. It is a road movie and I think it is a nice one. During the growth of the little Frank, it is not fair to him. His mom illegally took him away whe she divorced with her father and then abandoned him. Thanks God that there was a good man to help him when Frank was revenged by his ex-colleague because of his persistance on speaking truth. He then was taken care of by the good man and was educated and taught by him on how to be a man. This is the first turning point.

Here comes the second turning point when Frank met Kitty - his future partner. When Frank grew up, he became a motor police officier in Arizona state. He held his righteousness there and gained several awards in his career. But his personal life seemed to be messy. Kitty appears in his life when he happened to get into a car accident when he chased a crazy man. Kitty grew to fall in love with Frank when she gradually knew more about Frank. This was gift from lord to Frank. They both knew the feeling of each other. But due to the disciplines of office, they could not speak it out. 

Finally, a boy called Micheal/Mike changed Frank's mindset. Mike had cancer and is goint to die in a week. But he has a wish to become a motor police officier. His grandfather asked Frank's boss for help. This event reminds Frank that he should do what he was supposed to because of the lord have paved the way for him. Kitty told him that he would be very meaningful to Mike if he could make Mike's wish to come true.

Because of Mike's story, Frank found his blood father 35 years later. That was so surprised to me. I felt so moved that his blood father did not give up to find his son back. Frank said he would launch a foundation after Mike's funeral which is aiming to help any kid who has a wish. The successfully set the foundation up and maintain it till now.
