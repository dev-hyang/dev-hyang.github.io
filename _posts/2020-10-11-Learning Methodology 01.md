# What's Feynman Technique
* Step1, Set a target
First, we are going to set a learning target. We then could use different methods, either online self-learning, reading books/papers/ or go to classrooms to understand and master the concepts.

* Step2, Lecturer simulation
Pretend you are going to teach your "students" about the concepts you learned for the past few days. Prepare for the PPT and give a speech  to present the concepts to them.

* Step3, Collect Feedback
Ask your audiences(your family or classmates) to give you the feedback
	+ which parts they could not understand, confusing or tatolly in a loss
	+ which parts not clear enough, use better examples/illustrations

* Step4, Simplify
The key is to solve the problems from the feedback and make it better next time. Give a **simpler** and more undestandable solution,  and iterates Step 2 to Step 3.
